Recognition of the limitations, as well as the capabilities, of reason is far more beneficial than blind trust,
which can lead to false ideologies and even to destruction.

Describing the ancient greek academic class:
"All phenomena apparent to the senses, from the motions of the planets to the stirrings of the leaves on a tree, 
can be fitted into a precise, coherent, intelligible patten.
...[T]his pattern, though unaffected by human actions, can be apprehended by man's mind."

[T]he subtlety of nature is greater many times over than the subtlety of argument.

-- Francis Bacon

[A]s far as any rose can remember, no gardener has ever died.

-- Bernard de Fontenelle

A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see light,
but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with.

-- Max Planck

[O]ur firmest convictions... mark not our conquests but our limitations and our bounds.

On the banks of the Rhine, a beautiful castle had been standing for centuries.
In the cellar of the castle, an intricate network of webbing had been constructed by industrious spiders who lived there.
One day a strong gust of wind sprang up and destroyed the web.
Frantically the spiders worked to repair the damage.
They thought it was their webbing that was holding up the castle.

An idealist cannot last long unless he is a realist and a realist cannot last long unless he is an idealist.

-- Talleyrand (probably paraphrased)

Logic is invincible because one must use logic to defeat logic.

-- Oliver Heaviside

Mathematic [has] grown like a tree, which... sends its roots deeper and deeper at the same time and rate that its branches and leaves are spreading upward...
We see, then, that as regards the fundamental investigation in mathematics, there is no final ending, and therefore on the other hand, no first beginning.

-- Felix Klein

Sufficient unto the day is the rigor thereof.

-- E. H. Moore

Reason's last step is the recognition that there are an infinite number of things that are beyond it.

-- Pascal

The supreme triumph of reason is to cast doubt on its own validity.

-- Miguel de Unamuno

It seems to me that the assumption of [mathematical] objects is quite as legitimate as the assumption of physical objects and there is quite as much reason to believe in their existence.
They are in the same sense necessary to obtain a satisfactory theory of mathematics as physical bodies are necessary for a satisfactory theory of our sense perceptions...

-- GÃ¶del

Truth is so subtle a point that our instruments are too blunt to touch it directly.

-- Pascal

I rebut Percy W. Bridgman "It is the merest trusm, evident at once to unsophisticated observation, that mathematics is a human invention", by noting that though the telesope is a human invention, this fact does not diminish the reality of Saturn's rings.
